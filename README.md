# DataCamp
DataCamp data-science courses I have completed.

As I took the courses on Datacamp, I realized these examples would be useful for reference in the future.
Originally forked from wblakecannon because I am way too lazy to build a directory of courses from scratch.
I'm sure I will refer to these snippets many times in the future.

#current status: switch out all of blake's certificates for my own. *in progress*
